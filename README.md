# Networks and Systems Compiler Design Coursework

The main aim of this coursework is to design and implement a parser for First-Order Logic(FO)

## Objectives

### Input

The input to your program includes two things:

- The Language of the First order logic, including:
  - A set of variables
  - A set of constants
  - A set of predicates
  - The equality symbol
  - The set of logical connectives
- The description of a (possibly non-valid) FO formula

### Output

Upon reading the input file, your program should return the following outputs:

- The corresponding grammar for the language of valid FO formulae
- The parse tree of a valid formula
- A log file
